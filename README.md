# Image-Processing

This is a task project in Computer Vision Workshop held from March to April 2022 conducted by Technology Robotics Society , IIT kharagpur.

We have been assigned this Project to understand different image processing techniques with opencv and numpy library.

The goal of this project is to apply different shortest path algorithms to find shortest distance between two locations after processing a image of that locality.

first we get the original image from google maps.

But to apply algorithms we have to convert it into a binary image so we apply musking.

we can make this more accurate by erode and dilate. This is our final image for processing.
